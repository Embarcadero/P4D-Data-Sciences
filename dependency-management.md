Notes on exploring dependencies

* https://github.blog/2020-08-04-secure-at-every-step-how-githubs-dependency-graph-is-generated/
* Ideally get Boss listed and supported for Delphi
* https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph#supported-package-ecosystems
* Maybe hijack PIP's requirements.txt or NuGet/Chocolatey?
* https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-nuget-registry
* https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/
* Or maybe via GitHub Workflows?
* https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows
